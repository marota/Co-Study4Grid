# Interaction Logging & Session Replay

## Overview

Co-Study4Grid logs every user interaction during a session as a timestamped, **replay-ready** event log. The log contains enough data for an automated agent (e.g. browser automation) to deterministically reproduce the exact same session — same clicks, same selections, same analysis runs — without human input.

The log is saved as a dedicated `interaction_log.json` file alongside `session.json` when saving results.

---

## Design Principles

1. **Self-contained events**: Each event carries all input parameters needed to replay the action, not just a label. An agent reading the log should never need to infer missing data.
2. **Deterministic ordering**: Events are strictly ordered by timestamp. Async completions are logged as separate events with a `correlation_id` linking them to their trigger.
3. **Wait-for-completion semantics**: Events that trigger async work (API calls, streaming) log both a `*_started` and `*_completed` event. A replay agent must wait for the completion event's conditions (API response received) before proceeding to the next action.
4. **UI-level actions**: Log what the user did (clicked, selected, toggled), not internal React state changes. Each event maps to a specific UI gesture that a browser automation agent can reproduce.
5. **Sequence numbering**: Each event gets a monotonically increasing `seq` number for unambiguous ordering, even if timestamps collide.

---

## Event Format

Each entry in `interaction_log.json` follows this structure:

```typescript
interface InteractionLogEntry {
  seq: number;                     // Monotonic sequence number (0-based)
  timestamp: string;               // ISO 8601
  type: InteractionType;           // Event type (see below)
  details: Record<string, unknown>;// Type-specific replay payload
  correlation_id?: string;         // Links async start/complete pairs
  duration_ms?: number;            // For *_completed events: wall-clock duration
}
```

## Replay Contract: Required Details Per Event Type

Each event's `details` field contains **all parameters needed to replay** the user action.

### Configuration & Study Loading

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `config_loaded` | `{ network_path, action_file_path, layout_path, output_folder_path, min_line_reconnections, min_close_coupling, min_open_coupling, min_line_disconnections, min_pst, min_load_shedding, min_renewable_curtailment_actions, n_prioritized_actions, lines_monitoring_path, monitoring_factor, pre_existing_overload_threshold, ignore_reconnections, pypowsybl_fast_mode, model, compute_overflow_graph }` | Click "Load Study" with these config values |
| `settings_opened` | `{ tab: 'paths'\|'recommender'\|'configurations' }` | Click gear icon |
| `settings_tab_changed` | `{ from_tab: 'paths'\|'recommender'\|'configurations', to_tab: 'paths'\|'recommender'\|'configurations' }` — only emitted when `from_tab !== to_tab` | Click tab in settings modal |
| `settings_applied` | Same payload as `config_loaded` (full settings snapshot, including `model` and `compute_overflow_graph`). Treated as a wait-point: the replay agent must wait for the network reload to finish before proceeding. | Fill all fields → click Apply |
| `settings_cancelled` | `{}` | Click Cancel / close settings |
| `path_picked` | `{ type: 'file'\|'dir', path: string }` — the setter (network/action/layout/output/monitoring) is implicit from the preceding UI sequence (the settings modal field focused before the picker opened). | Click file picker → select path |

> **Note on new recommender thresholds**: `min_load_shedding` and `min_renewable_curtailment_actions` were introduced alongside the new `loads_p` / `gens_p` power-reduction action format. They MUST be present in both `config_loaded` and `settings_applied` details so a replay agent can set the thresholds before loading the study. Older logs that predate these fields will be replayed with the backend defaults (`0.0`).

> **Note on pluggable recommender model**: `model` (the string id of the selected recommender, e.g. `"expert"`, `"random"`, `"random_overflow"`) and `compute_overflow_graph` (boolean — whether step 1 must regenerate the overflow analysis graph) were added with the pluggable recommendation model feature. Both fields are now part of every `config_loaded` and `settings_applied` payload so a replay agent can reproduce the exact model + step-1 configuration the operator chose. Older logs that predate these fields fall back to `"expert"` and `true` respectively on replay (matching the historical hard-coded behaviour). See [`docs/backend/recommender_models.md`](../backend/recommender_models.md) for the full model contract and how to plug a third-party model.

### Contingency Selection

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `contingency_selected` | `{ element: string }` | Select value in branch dropdown |
| `contingency_confirmed` | `{ type: 'contingency'\|'loadStudy'\|'applySettings'\|'changeNetwork', pending_branch?: string }` — `type` identifies which confirmation dialog the user clicked OK on (contingency-change / reload-study / apply-settings / change-network-path). `pending_branch` is only populated for `type: 'contingency'`. | Click OK in confirmation dialog |

### Two-Step Analysis

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `analysis_step1_started` | `{ element: string }` | Click "Detect Overloads" |
| `analysis_step1_completed` | `{ element, overloads_found: string[], n_overloads: string[], can_proceed: bool, dc_fallback: bool, message: string }` | *(wait point — agent waits for API response)* |
| `overload_toggled` | `{ overload: string, selected: bool }` | Click checkbox for overload |
| `additional_line_to_cut_toggled` | `{ line: string, selected: bool }` | Add/remove an extra "line to cut" beyond the detected overloads |
| `analysis_step2_started` | `{ element, selected_overloads: string[], all_overloads: string[], monitor_deselected: bool, additional_lines_to_cut?: string[] }` | Click "Resolve Selected Overloads" |
| `analysis_step2_completed` | `{ n_actions: number, action_ids: string[], dc_fallback: bool, message: string, pdf_url: string\|null, active_model?: string, compute_overflow_graph?: boolean }` — `active_model` echoes the recommender id that actually produced the action set on the backend; `compute_overflow_graph` echoes whether the overflow analysis graph was generated for this run. Both are sourced from the final `result` event of the step-2 NDJSON stream. | *(wait point)* |
| `prioritized_actions_displayed` | `{ n_actions: number }` | Click "Display Prioritized Actions" button |
| `recommender_model_changed` | `{ model: string, source?: 'action_feed' \| 'settings' }` — `model` is the new recommender registry id the operator selected. `source` identifies which dropdown changed: the selector above the Analyze & Suggest button (`'action_feed'`) or the Settings → Recommender tab (`'settings'`, omitted on older logs). The change is pushed to the backend via `POST /api/recommender-model` so the **next** analysis run uses it — replay must therefore emit this event *before* the following `analysis_step2_started`. | Pick a model in the dropdown above Analyze & Suggest, or in Settings → Recommender |
| `suggested_actions_cleared` | `{ n_cleared: number }` — `n_cleared` is the count of recommender suggestions removed from the feed (those the operator had NOT starred / rejected / manually added — those are kept). Fired only after the operator confirms the "Clear Suggestions?" dialog. Does not re-run the analysis on its own. | Click the **Clear** button under the Suggested Actions tab header → confirm the dialog |

### Action Interactions

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `action_selected` | `{ action_id: string }` | Click action card |
| `action_deselected` | `{ previous_action_id: string }` | Click elsewhere / select null |
| `action_favorited` | `{ action_id: string }` | Click star icon |
| `action_unfavorited` | `{ action_id: string }` | Click star icon (toggle off) |
| `action_rejected` | `{ action_id: string }` | Click reject icon |
| `action_unrejected` | `{ action_id: string }` | Click reject icon (toggle off) |
| `manual_action_simulated` | `{ action_id: string }` | Search action → click Simulate |
| `action_mw_resimulated` | `{ action_id: string, target_mw: number }` — the raw user-entered MW value (backend may clamp). Wait-point: the action card updates with new `rho_after`, `load_shedding_details` / `curtailment_details`. The action stays in its current bucket (suggested vs. manual). | Edit Target MW input on a load-shedding or curtailment card → click Re-simulate |
| `pst_tap_resimulated` | `{ action_id: string, target_tap: number }` — the raw user-entered tap integer. Backend clamps to `[low_tap, high_tap]`. Wait-point: same as MW re-simulation but the `pst_details.tap_position` is updated instead. | Edit Target Tap input on a PST card → click Re-simulate |

### Combined Actions

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `combine_modal_opened` | `{}` | Click "Combine Actions" button |
| `combine_modal_closed` | `{}` | Close modal |
| `combine_pair_toggled` | `{ action_id: string, selected: bool }` | Toggle checkbox in pair selection |
| `combine_pair_estimated` | `{ action1_id, action2_id, estimated_max_rho: number, estimated_max_rho_line: string }` | *(auto after pair selected — wait point)* |
| `combine_pair_simulated` | `{ combined_id: string, action1_id, action2_id, simulated_max_rho: number\|null }` | Click "Simulate" on pair row |

### Visualization

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `diagram_tab_changed` | `{ tab: TabId }` — the destination tab the user clicked. | Click tab button |
| `tab_detached` | `{ tab: TabId }` — the tab moved into a secondary browser window. Wait-point: the popup must be open and the portal target mounted before the next event can be replayed. Replay agents that cannot script a real popup should skip this event and keep the content in the main window. | Click the "Detach" button on a tab header |
| `tab_reattached` | `{ tab: TabId }` | Click the "Reattach" badge in the popup (or "Reattach" in the main window placeholder) |
| `tab_tied` | `{ tab: TabId }` — starts mirroring the detached tab's viewBox one-way into the main window's active tab. | Click "Tie" on a detached tab header |
| `tab_untied` | `{ tab: TabId }` — stops mirroring. Also fired automatically when a tied tab is reattached. | Click "Untie" on a detached tab header |
| `view_mode_changed` | `{ mode: 'network'\|'delta', tab: TabId, scope: 'main'\|'detached' }` — Flow/Impacts is now per-tab AND per-window: toggling in a detached popup only affects that popup's tab. | Click Flows/Impacts toggle |
| `voltage_range_changed` | `{ min: number, max: number }` (kV) | Drag voltage slider |
| `asset_clicked` | `{ action_id: string, asset_name: string, tab: 'n'\|'n-1'\|'action' }` — `tab` is the destination tab for the zoom. When the click comes from the sticky contingency / overloads sidebar (`handleZoomOnActiveTab`), `tab` is set to the **currently active** diagram tab and `action_id` is the empty string — meaning "zoom this asset in place without switching tabs". | Click a rho-line badge or a sticky contingency / overload link |
| `zoom_in` | `{ tab: TabId }` | Click + button |
| `zoom_out` | `{ tab: TabId }` | Click - button |
| `zoom_reset` | `{ tab: TabId }` | Click reset button |
| `inspect_query_changed` | `{ query: string, target_tab?: TabId }` — `target_tab` is only present when the inspect field was triggered from a detached-tab overlay (per-tab inspect routing). Absent = main-window active tab. | Type in search box |
| `vl_names_toggled` | `{ show: boolean }` — new visibility state of the `🏷 VL` toggle (default ON). Toggles the `nad-hide-vl-labels` CSS class on every NAD tab; the labels remain reachable via the per-bus `<title>` tooltip injected by `applyVlTitles`. | Click `🏷 VL` next to the bottom-left Inspect field. |

### Action Overview Diagram

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `overview_shown` | `{ has_pins: boolean, pin_count: number }` — the overview became visible (no card selected). `pin_count` is 0 before the first analysis runs. | Switch to the Remedial Action tab with no card selected, or deselect a card. |
| `overview_hidden` | `{}` — the overview was folded away because a card was selected or the tab was switched. | Select an action card (double-click pin, click card body, etc.). |
| `overview_pin_clicked` | `{ action_id: string }` — a single click opened the floating ActionCard popover next to the pin. | Click a pin once (popover preview). |
| `overview_pin_double_clicked` | `{ action_id: string }` — a double-click activated the full action drill-down view (the action-variant diagram replaces the overview in the tab). Cancels any pending single-click popover. | Double-click a pin. |
| `overview_popover_closed` | `{ reason: 'close_button' \| 'escape' \| 'outside_click' }` — the popover was dismissed. Drill-down activation fires `overview_pin_double_clicked` instead (no popover-close event in that case). | Close the popover via ✕, Escape, or clicking outside. |
| `overview_zoom_in` | `{}` | Click the overview `+` zoom button. |
| `overview_zoom_out` | `{}` | Click the overview `-` zoom button. |
| `overview_zoom_fit` | `{}` — resets the viewBox to the auto-fit rectangle (contingency + overloads + pins). | Click the overview `Fit` button. |
| `overview_inspect_changed` | `{ query: string, action: 'focus' \| 'cleared' }` — `focus` means the typed query matched an exact equipment id and the view zoomed onto it. `cleared` means the query was emptied and the view returned to the fit rectangle. Intermediate keystrokes that don't match are not logged. | Type in the overview inspect field or clear it. |
| `overview_filter_changed` | `{ kind: 'category' \| 'categories_bulk' \| 'threshold' \| 'action_type' \| 'combined_only' \| 'overflow_iframe', category?: ActionSeverityCategory, enabled?: boolean, threshold?: number, action_type?: ActionTypeFilterToken }` — the discriminator `kind` says which chip / control changed: a single severity chip (`category` + `enabled`), the All / None bulk-select pills (`categories_bulk` + `enabled`), the Max-loading numeric input (`threshold`), the action-type chip row (`action_type`), the Combined-only checkbox (`combined_only` + `enabled` — pin-scoped flag that hides everything except combined pins + their constituents), or a chip change inside the Overflow Analysis iframe sidebar (`overflow_iframe` — the parent re-broadcasts the new filters via `cs4g:filters`). Logged for every change of `ActionOverviewFilters`, regardless of the surface that triggered it, so the Action Feed / Action Overview pins / overflow pins always reach the same filter state on replay. | Click a category chip, the All / None pill, edit the Max-loading input, click an action-type chip, click the Combined-only checkbox, OR change any of those in the Overflow Analysis iframe sidebar. |
| `overview_unsimulated_toggled` | `{ enabled: boolean }` — new state of the **Show unsimulated** checkbox. Drives the dashed grey "?" pin layer on both the Action Overview NAD and (gated on the same flag) the Overflow Analysis iframe. | Click the **Show unsimulated** checkbox in the Action Overview filters or the iframe filters panel. |
| `overview_unsimulated_pin_simulated` | `{ action_id: string }` — the action a double-click kicked off a manual simulation for. Emitted by both the Action Overview NAD and the Overflow Analysis iframe (the latter forwards the gesture via `cs4g:overflow-unsimulated-pin-double-clicked`). Wait-point: the simulated action eventually appears in the Action Feed and replaces the dashed pin with a coloured one. | Double-click an unsimulated pin on either surface. |

### Overflow Analysis Tab

The Overflow Analysis iframe forwards user gestures to the parent React app via `postMessage`, where they are recorded as the events below. See `docs/features/interactive-overflow-analysis.md` §8 for the full message-routing contract.

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `overflow_layout_mode_toggled` | `{ to: 'hierarchical' \| 'geo' }` on start; the corresponding `_completed` event carries `{ to, cached: boolean }` (or `{ to, error: string }` on failure). Wait-point: the iframe URL refreshes once the backend regenerates / serves the requested layout. | Click the Hierarchical / Geo layout switch on the Overflow Analysis tab. |
| `overflow_pins_toggled` | `{ enabled: boolean }` — new state of the toolbar `📌 Pins` button. Disabled until step-2 has streamed actions; default OFF. When `enabled === true`, the parent posts the `cs4g:pins` payload to the iframe and the action pin layer becomes visible. | Click the `📌 Pins` toolbar toggle on the Overflow Analysis tab. |
| `overflow_pin_clicked` | `{ actionId: string }` — single click on an action pin inside the iframe. The Action Feed scrolls to the matching card AND a floating `ActionCardPopover` opens anchored on the pin. Does NOT switch the active main tab. | Click a pin once on the Overflow Analysis tab. |
| `overflow_pin_double_clicked` | `{ actionId: string, substation: string }` — double-click on an action pin. Closes any open popover and opens the SLD overlay scoped to that substation with `forceTab='action'`. Logged ONLY when `result.actions[actionId]` exists — stale double-clicks (action evicted by re-analysis) are silently dropped. | Double-click an action pin. |
| `overflow_layer_toggled` | `{ key: string, label: string, visible: boolean }` — `key` is the canonical layer key (e.g. `"semantic:is_hub"`, `"color:coral"`); `label` is the human-readable sidebar label; `visible` is the new checkbox state (dim-instead-of-hide membership recomputed from this). | Tick / untick a layer checkbox in the iframe sidebar. |
| `overflow_select_all_layers` | `{ visible: boolean }` — bulk-flip of every layer checkbox via the **Select all · Unselect all** link row above the layer list. | Click **Select all** or **Unselect all** in the iframe sidebar. |
| `overflow_node_double_clicked` | `{ name: string }` — substation / VL name of the double-clicked overflow-graph node. The parent's `onVlOpen` handler routes to the SLD overlay using the same path as a NAD VL double-click. | Double-click a node in the overflow graph. |

### SLD Overlay

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `sld_overlay_opened` | `{ vl_name: string, action_id: string\|null }` — the currently-selected action ID (may be empty) is always carried through, even when the active tab is N / N-1, so the SLD's internal sub-tab buttons can switch to the action view without a backend lookup error. | Double-click VL node |
| `sld_overlay_tab_changed` | `{ tab: SldTab, vl_name: string }` — the destination SLD sub-tab. | Click tab in SLD overlay |
| `sld_overlay_closed` | `{}` | Click close on SLD overlay |

### Session Management

| Event | Details | Replay Action |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `session_saved` | `{ output_folder: string }` | Click "Save Results" |
| `session_reload_modal_opened` | `{}` — the list of available sessions is fetched async and is not part of the event payload. | Click "Reload Session" |
| `session_reloaded` | `{ session_name: string }` | Click session in list |

---

## Replay Agent Contract

### Event Processing Loop

```
for each event in interaction_log (ordered by seq):
  1. Wait for app to be idle (no pending API calls, no loading spinners)
  2. Execute the UI action described by event.type + event.details
  3. If event has a correlation_id and is a *_started event:
     - Execute the action
     - Wait for the matching *_completed event's conditions to be met
     - (The completed event is informational — the agent doesn't "replay" it,
        it waits for the app to produce that state naturally)
  4. Proceed to next event
```

### Wait Points (Async Operations)

These events trigger async API calls. The replay agent must wait for the operation to complete before proceeding:

| Trigger Event | Wait Condition |
|---------------|----------------|
| `config_loaded` | Network loaded, branches list populated. The selected `model` is honoured backend-side — if the model requires the overflow analysis graph, `compute_overflow_graph` is forced to `true` regardless of what was logged. |
| `analysis_step1_started` | Loading spinner gone, overload list populated |
| `analysis_step2_started` | Streaming complete, action cards visible, `lines_overloaded_rho` populated on the N-1 payload for the sidebar sticky header. The `active_model` carried by the completion event must match the requested `model` (or the recorded fallback if the requested model was unknown). |
| `action_selected` | Action diagram loaded (or simulation fallback complete) |
| `manual_action_simulated` | Action card appears in feed |
| `action_mw_resimulated` | Action card updates with new `rho_after` and refreshed `load_shedding_details` / `curtailment_details`; the card stays in its current bucket |
| `pst_tap_resimulated` | Action card updates with new `rho_after` and refreshed `pst_details.tap_position`; the card stays in its current bucket |
| `combine_pair_estimated` | Estimation values appear in modal |
| `combine_pair_simulated` | Simulation values appear in modal |
| `session_reloaded` | Full session state restored (see "Session reload fidelity" below) |
| `settings_applied` | Network reloaded, branches refreshed. Same `model` / `compute_overflow_graph` semantics as `config_loaded`. |
| `tab_detached` | Popup opened, React portal target mounted — or the event is skipped if the runner can't open real popups |
| `tab_reattached` | Popup closed, content re-rendered in the main window |
| `overflow_layout_mode_toggled` | Overflow iframe URL refreshes after the backend regenerates / serves the requested layout (`POST /api/regenerate-overflow-graph`); the matching `_completed` event carries `cached: bool` or `error: string`. |
| `overview_unsimulated_pin_simulated` | The dashed `?` pin is replaced by a coloured pin once the manual simulation lands in `result.actions`. |
| `recommender_model_changed` | The model is pushed to the running backend via `POST /api/recommender-model` (a lightweight swap — no network reload). The replay agent must let that POST settle before the next `analysis_step2_started`, otherwise the run uses the previous model. |

### Handling `*_completed` Events

Completed events are **informational checkpoints**, not actions to replay. They serve two purposes:

1. **Verification**: The agent can compare actual app state against the logged `details` to detect divergence (e.g., different number of overloads found → data changed)
2. **Timing**: The `duration_ms` field gives realistic timing for the original session

### Correlation IDs

Async start/complete pairs share a `correlation_id` (UUID). This allows the agent to:
- Match starts with completions
- Handle nested async operations (e.g., analysis running while diagrams load)
- Detect interrupted operations (start without matching complete = user cancelled/errored)

---

## Pluggable recommender model

The `model` and `compute_overflow_graph` fields surfaced in `config_loaded`, `settings_applied` and `analysis_step2_completed` map directly to the pluggable recommendation model contract documented in [`docs/backend/recommender_models.md`](../backend/recommender_models.md).

- `model` is the **registry id** of the selected recommender. Built-in ids are `"expert"` (default, equivalent to the legacy hard-coded pipeline), `"random"` and `"random_overflow"` (canonical examples shipped under `expert_backend/recommenders/`). Third-party models registered by external packages add their own ids.
- `compute_overflow_graph` is the **operator-level toggle** for the overflow analysis graph generated by step 1. It is independent of the model choice **unless** the active recommender declares `requires_overflow_graph = True`, in which case the toggle is locked to `true` in the UI and forced to `true` on the backend. The Random model is the canonical test example of a model that does NOT require the graph but can still benefit from it when the operator opts in.
- On the backend, the final `result` event of the step-2 NDJSON stream echoes `active_model` (the recommender that actually ran — may differ from the requested `model` if it was unknown, in which case the backend falls back to `"expert"`) and `compute_overflow_graph` (whether the overflow analysis graph was generated for this run). The replay logger forwards both into `analysis_step2_completed` details.

A replay agent that wants to faithfully reproduce a session MUST honour both fields when restoring settings before clicking "Load Study" / "Apply". Older logs that predate the feature lack these fields and replay against the default `"expert"` / `true` pair — which matches the historical hard-coded behaviour byte-for-byte.

### Mid-session model swaps

The model can also be changed **without** re-opening Settings — via the dropdown directly above the **Analyze & Suggest** button (a mirror of the Settings → Recommender selector). Every change to either dropdown emits a `recommender_model_changed` event and is pushed to the running `RecommenderService` through the lightweight `POST /api/recommender-model` endpoint (no network reload, no action-dictionary rebuild). The next `analysis_step2_started` then runs against the new model.

The companion **Clear** button under the Suggested Actions tab header wipes the recommender suggestions the operator has not triaged (un-starred, un-rejected, not manually added) and emits `suggested_actions_cleared`. It is confirmation-gated (shared `<ConfirmationDialog/>`, `type: 'clearSuggested'`) and does **not** re-run the analysis — the operator clears, optionally swaps the model, then presses Analyze & Suggest. A replay agent reproducing a "swap model and re-run" sequence will therefore see, in order: `suggested_actions_cleared` → `recommender_model_changed` → `analysis_step1_started` → `analysis_step2_started`.

Neither event needs separate session persistence: the model choice survives a reload through `configuration.model` / `analysis.active_model` (see [Session reload fidelity](#session-reload-fidelity)), and the *effect* of a clear is captured in the saved action set + status flags. They are pure replay-log gestures.

---

## Session reload fidelity

The `session_reloaded` wait-point above is only meaningful if the saved session actually contains everything the UI needs. Because several features have been added to `session.json` incrementally, this section documents exactly what is persisted and restored so replay agents and downstream tools know which fields are trustworthy on reload.

### Configuration

Every field listed in `config_loaded` / `settings_applied` is persisted under `session.configuration` and restored by `useSession.handleRestoreSession`. This includes:

- `min_load_shedding` and `min_renewable_curtailment_actions` — required for the new `loads_p` / `gens_p` power-reduction format. Older session dumps that predate these fields fall back to `0.0` on reload.
- `model` and `compute_overflow_graph` — the operator's recommender model id and overflow-graph toggle at save time (pluggable recommendation model feature). Older session dumps that predate these fields fall back to `"expert"` and `true` on reload, matching the historical hard-coded behaviour. See `docs/features/save-results.md` for the full persistence contract (configuration vs. analysis split).

On restore, `committedNetworkPathRef` is set to the restored `network_path`. This is important: it's what gates the "Change Network?" confirmation dialog when the user subsequently edits the Header network input. Without this update the dialog would either misfire (empty ref) or fire against a stale previous value.

### Overloads & sticky header ratios

`session.overloads` now contains:

- `n_overloads: string[]`, `n1_overloads: string[]`, `resolved_overloads: string[]` — as before.
- `n_overloads_rho?: number[]`, `n1_overloads_rho?: number[]` — the per-element loading ratios (`max|i|/permanent_limit`) that feed the sticky sidebar summary (PR #88). Persisted only when their length matches the element-name array; otherwise omitted to avoid misaligned percentages. Older session dumps that predate the sticky header simply don't have these arrays.

After reload, the sidebar sticky header renders percentages for these overloaded lines without requiring a fresh analysis run. The live `n1Diagram.lines_overloaded_rho` that fills the in-memory state comes from the re-fetched N-1 diagram (after `setSelectedBranch` fires), so the persisted arrays are primarily useful for inspection of standalone `session.json` dumps and for replay agents that don't actually re-run the backend.

### Action enrichment fields

Saved `SavedActionEntry` objects carry the enrichment fields added by PRs #73, #78 and #83:

- `lines_overloaded_after: string[]` — post-action overload list, used by SLD / NAD highlight clones on the Remedial Action tab.
- `load_shedding_details: LoadSheddingDetail[]` — per-load MW values for the load-shedding editor card.
- `curtailment_details: CurtailmentDetail[]` — per-generator MW values for the curtailment editor card.
- `pst_details: PstDetail[]` — `{ pst_name, tap_position, low_tap, high_tap }` for the PST editor card.

All four are now **restored** into the live `ActionDetail` objects by `handleRestoreSession`. Previously they were dropped on reload, which caused:

- The PST / load-shedding / curtailment editor cards to render empty until the user re-ran analysis.
- The Remedial Action tab to lose its post-action overload halos (`.nad-overloaded` clones) because `lines_overloaded_after` was gone.

If a replay agent depends on any of those post-load side effects, the reload path is now sufficient — no re-analysis required.

### Action status flags

`SavedActionStatus` (`is_selected`, `is_suggested`, `is_rejected`, `is_manually_simulated`) is persisted and restored as before. No changes to this contract.

### What is NOT persisted

- **Per-card edit state** (`cardEditMw`, `cardEditTap`): these are the raw, uncommitted values in the action card inputs. Only the committed, re-simulated result survives — persisted as `pst_details.tap_position` / `load_shedding_details[].shedded_mw` / `curtailment_details[].curtailed_mw`. A replay agent that wants to reproduce edit keystrokes must consume the `action_mw_resimulated` / `pst_tap_resimulated` events from `interaction_log.json` instead.
- **Detached / tied tab state** (PR #84/#85): `detachedTabs` and the tied-tab registry are deliberately ephemeral. Detaching a tab does not change any analysis result, so reload intentionally starts with all tabs attached to the main window. A replay that needs to reproduce detach / reattach / tie / untie must stream the matching events from `interaction_log.json`.
- **Overflow Analysis tab UI state**: `overflowPinsEnabled`, `overflowLayoutMode`, the iframe layer-toggle checkboxes and the shared `overviewFilters` (category chips / threshold / action-type / Show unsimulated / Combined only) are intentionally not in `session.json` — they reset on reload. A replay must stream `overflow_pins_toggled` / `overflow_layout_mode_toggled` / `overflow_layer_toggled` / `overflow_select_all_layers` / `overview_filter_changed` / `overview_unsimulated_toggled` from `interaction_log.json` to reach the same operator state.

## Output Structure

After saving, the session folder contains:

```
<output_folder>/
  costudy4grid_session_LINE_XYZ_2026-03-18T10-30-00/
    session.json            ← full state snapshot
    interaction_log.json    ← replay-ready event log
    overflow_abc123.pdf     ← overflow graph copy
```

## Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

The logger is a **singleton class** (not React state) to avoid unnecessary re-renders. It lives in `frontend/src/utils/interactionLogger.ts`:

```typescript
class InteractionLogger {
  private log: InteractionLogEntry[] = [];
  private seq = 0;

  record(type, details, correlationId?): string  // returns correlation_id
  recordCompletion(type, correlationId, details, startTimestamp): void
  getLog(): InteractionLogEntry[]                 // returns copy
  clear(): void                                   // resets log + seq
}

export const interactionLogger = new InteractionLogger();
```

- `record()` returns a `correlation_id` so callers can pass it to `recordCompletion()` for async pairs.
- `clear()` is called when a new study is loaded (new session scope).
- Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` for correlation IDs (no external dependency).

### Instrumented Handlers

User-facing handlers across `App.tsx`, `CombinedActionsModal.tsx`, `ActionFeed.tsx`, `SettingsModal.tsx` and the hook modules (`useActions.ts`, `useAnalysis.ts`, `useDiagrams.ts`, `useSession.ts`, `useSettings.ts`, `useSldOverlay.ts`, `useTiedTabsSync.ts`) call `interactionLogger.record()`. The rule of thumb is: **log where the user gesture is handled, not inside downstream reducers**. Re-simulation events are a good example — they used to be logged from the `useActions` hook but now live in `ActionFeed.handleResimulate` / `handleResimulateTap` because that's the only place where the user-edited `target_mw` / `target_tap` values are in scope. Async handlers use the start/complete pattern:

```typescript
const handleRunAnalysis = useCallback(async () => {
  const corrId = interactionLogger.record('analysis_step1_started', {
    element: selectedBranch,
  });
  const startTs = new Date().toISOString();
  try {
    const step1 = await api.runAnalysisStep1(selectedBranch);
    interactionLogger.recordCompletion('analysis_step1_completed', corrId, {
      element: selectedBranch,
      overloads_found: step1.lines_overloaded,
      // ...
    }, startTs);
  } catch (e) { /* ... */ }
}, [selectedBranch]);
```

The `config_loaded` and `settings_applied` payloads are built in `useSettings.ts` from the live form state — including the recommender model dropdown value (`recommenderModel`) and the Compute Overflow Graph toggle (`computeOverflowGraph`) — so they always reflect what the operator actually submitted, not the backend defaults.

### Save Flow

1. `handleSaveResults` passes `interactionLogger.getLog()` to `buildSessionResult()`
2. The log is serialized as a separate `interaction_log` field in the API call
3. Backend writes `interaction_log.json` alongside `session.json` in the session folder
4. The log is kept as a **separate file** (not embedded in `session.json`) to keep backward compatibility

### API Change

`POST /api/save-session` accepts an optional `interaction_log` string field:

```python
class SaveSessionRequest(BaseModel):
    session_name: str
    json_content: str
    pdf_path: str | None = None
    output_folder_path: str
    interaction_log: str | None = None
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`interactionLogger.test.ts`)

- `record()` appends entries with correct timestamp, type, and incrementing seq
- `record()` returns a correlation_id
- `recordCompletion()` links to the same correlation_id and includes duration_ms
- `getLog()` returns a copy (not a reference)
- `clear()` empties the log and resets seq counter
- Multiple records maintain insertion order

### Session Tests (`sessionUtils.test.ts`)

- `buildSessionResult` includes `interaction_log` when provided
- `interaction_log` is empty array when no interactions recorded
