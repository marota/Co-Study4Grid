# Interactive Overflow Analysis

The **Overflow Analysis** tab embeds the upstream alphaDeesp HTML viewer
in an iframe and augments it with Co-Study4Grid–specific behaviour:
semantic layer toggles, action pins synchronised with the Action
Overview NAD, drill-down to the SLD on double-click, edge / line
re-routing in geo mode, and a per-pin filter widget that mirrors the
Action Overview filters.

This document is the contract for that feature. It collects every
moving part — upstream tags, geo-transform behaviour, overlay
wire-format, click semantics, filter sync — so the next person
debugging or extending the tab does not have to reverse-engineer it
from the code.

Phase split:
- **Phase A (upstream)** — `expert_op4grid_recommender` /
  `alphaDeesp` get the source-of-truth tagging.
- **Phase B (Co-Study4Grid backend)** — overflow HTML serving, the
  overlay injector, the geo transform.
- **Phase C (Co-Study4Grid frontend)** — toolbar toggle, pin
  payload, popover, message routing, filter sync.

## 2. Source-of-truth attribute tagging (upstream)

The recommender sets these explicit boolean flags on the overflow
graph it produces. The interactive viewer simply scans them — no
heuristic re-derivation from colours / shapes.

### 2.1 Node attributes

| Attribute              | Set by                                  | Drives                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `is_hub=True`          | `set_hubs_shape(...)` (auto)            | `Hubs` layer                 |
| `in_red_loop=True`     | `tag_red_loops(lines, nodes)`            | `Red-loop paths` layer       |
| `on_constrained_path=True` | `tag_constrained_path(lines, nodes)` | `Constrained path` layer     |
| `prod_or_load="prod"` + `value`  | `build_nodes` (auto)              | `Production nodes` layer (≥ 1 MW floor) |
| `prod_or_load="load"` + `value`  | `build_nodes` (auto)              | `Consumption nodes` layer (≥ 1 MW floor) |

Hubs are auto-tagged with `in_red_loop` AND `on_constrained_path`
so they always show up under those layers regardless of how the
recommender's lists are built.

`prod_or_load` is written on **every** node by upstream `build_nodes`
(see `alphaDeesp/core/graphs/power_flow_graph.py` and the
simulator-specific `build_nodes_v2` helpers in
`alphaDeesp/core/{grid2op,powsybl,pypownet}/*Simulation.py`). The
sign of `prod_minus_load` decides the kind:

* `prod_minus_load > 0` → `prod_or_load="prod"`, fillcolor `coral`
* `prod_minus_load < 0` → `prod_or_load="load"`, fillcolor `lightblue`
* `prod_minus_load == 0` → `prod_or_load="load"`, fillcolor `#ffffed`
  (the white "passive substation" placeholder — every node carries
  this even when it has neither prod nor load)

The viewer therefore filters on `abs(value) >= _PROD_LOAD_VALUE_FLOOR_MW`
(1 MW by default) when populating the Production / Consumption layers
so the placeholder zero-balance nodes don't flood the Consumption
toggle. Bumping the floor is an
`alphaDeesp/core/interactive_html.py` knob.

### 2.2 Edge attributes

| Attribute              | Set by                                  | Drives                       |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `is_overload=True`     | `highlight_significant_line_loading`    | `Overloads` layer            |
| `is_monitored=True`    | `highlight_significant_line_loading`    | `Low margin lines` layer     |
| `in_red_loop=True`     | `tag_red_loops(lines, nodes)`            | `Red-loop paths` layer       |
| `on_constrained_path=True` | `tag_constrained_path(lines, nodes)` | `Constrained path` layer     |

`is_overload` is a strict subset of `is_monitored` — every overload
is also a low-margin line; the inverse is not true.

### 2.3 Recommender wiring

`make_overflow_graph_visualization` (in
`expert_op4grid_recommender.graph_analysis.visualization`) accepts
the four lists (constrained-path lines/nodes, red-loop lines/nodes)
and the overloads list, then calls `tag_constrained_path`,
`tag_red_loops`, and `highlight_significant_line_loading` on the
graph before serialising.

---

## 3. Layer-toggle UI (upstream `interactive_html.py`)

The viewer's sidebar groups layers into three labelled sections:

| Section                          | Layers                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structural Paths**             | Constrained path, Red-loop paths                                                                             |
| **Individual entities properties** | Reconnectable, Non-reconnectable, Swapped flow, Overloads, Low margin lines, Hubs, Production nodes, Consumption nodes |
| **Flow redispatch values**       | Positive, Negative, Null                                                                                     |

Production / Consumption nodes carry no edges — they are pure
node-only filters driven by `prod_or_load` + `value`. The sidebar
swatch is a small filled circle in the matching node fillcolor
(coral for prod, lightblue for load) so the visual mapping
between the swatch and the actual nodes on the canvas is direct.

### Section ordering

`_LAYER_SECTIONS` (Python dict in `interactive_html.py`) maps each
canonical layer key to its section. `_SECTION_ORDER` is the
top-to-bottom render order. Layers without a section assignment are
dropped entirely (e.g. the historical `color:black`, `color:gray`,
`color:darkred` buckets — replaced by the explicit `is_overload` /
`is_monitored` flags).

Each layer in the JSON model carries a `section` field; the JS
template emits one `<h3 class="layer-section-header">` whenever the
section name changes between consecutive layers.

### Dim-instead-of-hide

Toggling a layer off applies a `.layer-off` class to its claimed
nodes AND edges. The CSS rule is:

```css
.graph .layer-off { opacity: 0.12; }
```

(*not* `display: none` — pointer-events stay live, and the operator
can still see the topology).

### Membership-based dim model

Each node/edge knows the set of layers that claim it. The JS
recomputes `.layer-off` membership-wise: an element is visible iff
**at least one of its claiming layers is currently checked**. When
the operator unticks every layer, elements with no membership are
dimmed too (so a single-layer focus shows ONLY that layer).

### Endpoint-node inclusion

For colour layers, style layers, and the edge-only semantic layers
(Overloads, Low margin lines), the layer's `nodes` list is augmented
with the bbox-endpoint nodes of every claimed edge. Toggling
"Overloads" alone keeps the substations the overload connects
visible — no floating edges in dimmed space.

### Select-all / Unselect-all

A "Select all · Unselect all" link row sits above the layer
checkboxes; both flip every layer at once and dispatch the same
`change` event the individual checkboxes do.

### Edge-id alignment regression guard

`_align_edge_ids_with_svg()` walks the SVG `<title>` strings and
re-keys the JSON edge model so SVG `id="edgeN"` and JSON edge index
agree on `(src, dst)` endpoints. Without it, graphviz's two output
streams (SVG vs JSON) drift in independent orderings and the
`data-source` / `data-target` attributes on `<g class="edge">`
collide with their `<title>` content. This was a critical bug that
made the layer membership for some edges flat-out wrong.

---

## 4. Geo-mode SVG transform

The geo toggle calls `transform_html()` in
`expert_backend/services/analysis/overflow_geo_transform.py` to
re-place every node at its geographic coordinate (from
`grid_layout.json`) and redraw edges as straight lines.

### Edge rewriting

For each edge group in the SVG:
- Compute the new straight segment from source-node centre to
  target-node centre (with a small `node_gap` pull-back so the
  arrowhead tip lands on the node outline).
- For a regular edge (`<path>` + `<polygon>` arrowhead):
  - Rewrite the path's `d` to a single `M src L tgt`.
  - Rewrite the arrowhead polygon's `points` via
    `_arrowhead_points` (proportional to the edge stroke width).
  - Zero its `stroke-width` (graphviz inherits a heavy stroke onto
    the polygon that turns the triangle into a chunky blob).
- For a **tapered** edge (`data-attr-style="tapered"` =
  swapped-flow line):
  - Detected upfront — graphviz emits TWO polygons (long ~21-vertex
    body + 4-vertex arrowhead) and **no** path.
  - `_rewrite_tapered_edge` rewrites the body polygon to a 4-vertex
    tapered strip via `_tapered_strip_points` (wide at source,
    narrow at target — same visual cue as the hierarchical layout).
  - The second polygon stays the arrowhead.
  - Without this special case the body polygon was overwritten with
    a 3-vertex triangle and the swapped-flow line had no visible
    body.

---

## 5. Overlay injection

`expert_backend/services/overflow_overlay.py:inject_overlay(html)`
splices a single `<style>` + `<script>` block (with deterministic
`id` attributes) before the closing `</body>` tag. Idempotent — a
re-injection on the same file replaces the previous block.

The `<script>` body is built from a Python f-string that interleaves:
1. The full content of the **shared module**
   `frontend/src/utils/svg/pinGlyph.js` (read at request time, with
   ESM `export` keywords stripped via regex). Both this script
   AND the React Action Overview pin renderer (`actionPinRender.ts`)
   call into the same `createPinGlyph` factory — visual contract,
   colour palette, status symbols all in one place.
2. The Co-Study4Grid–specific overlay code (filters panel, pin
   layer, click handlers).

A regression test (`test_injected_script_parses_as_valid_js`) asserts
the resulting script parses cleanly. A duplicate `const SVG_NS`
between `pinGlyph.js` and the overlay IIFE silently disabled every
listener once — guarded since.

---

## 6. Action-pin overlay

### 6.1 Pin payload (parent → iframe)

```ts
interface OverflowPin {
    actionId: string;
    /** Primary anchor: substation id (overflow node `data-name`). */
    substation: string;
    /** Fallback node anchors when the graph is keyed by VL ids. */
    nodeCandidates?: string[];
    /** Edge anchors — pin lands at the midpoint of the matching edge. */
    lineNames?: string[];
    label: string;            // e.g. "92%", "DIV", "ISL"
    severity: 'green' | 'orange' | 'red' | 'grey';
    isSelected: boolean;
    isRejected: boolean;
}
```

Posted as `{ type: 'cs4g:pins', visible, pins: OverflowPin[] }`.

### 6.2 Anchor priority (mirrors `actionPinData.resolveActionAnchor`)

`buildOverflowPinPayload` in
`frontend/src/utils/svg/overflowPinPayload.ts` resolves each action
to an anchor in this priority order:

1. **Load-shedding / curtailment** → VL node directly (early
   return; never carries `lineNames`).
2. **Primary line targets** (`getActionTargetLines`) → emits
   `lineNames=[…]`; overlay anchors at edge midpoint.
3. **Voltage-level targets** (`getActionTargetVoltageLevels`) → VL
   node anchor.
4. **`max_rho_line` fallback** — only used when neither (2) nor (3)
   produced anything; emitted as the single `lineNames` entry.

This mimics `resolveActionAnchor` for the Action Overview NAD.
Coupler / node-merging / generic VL actions therefore land on their
substation node, NOT on their incidental `max_rho_line`.

### 6.3 Pin rendering — shared glyph factory

`frontend/src/utils/svg/pinGlyph.js` is plain ES JavaScript with
two consumers:

- **React/TS bundle**: imported by `actionPinRender.ts` for the
  Action Overview NAD pin layer.
- **Iframe overlay**: read as text by the Python backend, ESM
  `export` keywords stripped, body inlined into the overlay
  `<script>` block.

The factory returns an `<g class="cs4g-pin">` element with:
- Teardrop bubble (half-circle on top, tip at the anchor (0, 0))
  drawn by a single `<path>` whose fill follows the severity
  palette (`SEVERITY_FILL` / `_DIMMED` / `_HIGHLIGHTED`).
- White chrome circle behind the loading-rate label.
- Status symbol above the bubble: gold star when selected, red cross
  when rejected.
- Same colour palette as the React `pinColors*` design tokens (a
  `pinGlyph.test.ts` assertion enforces parity).

### 6.4 Anchoring math (overlay-side)

`overflow_overlay.py` provides four helpers:

- `projectToLayer(node, layer, lx, ly)` — composes
  `layer.getCTM().inverse() × node.getCTM()` to map a point from a
  node's local coordinate space into the pin layer's space. The pin
  layer is appended INSIDE `<g class="graph">` so it inherits
  graphviz's translate / scale; without the CTM math, `getBBox()`
  returned coordinates that don't include the node's own
  `translate(...)` and every pin landed at (0, 0) of `g.graph`.
- `nodeCentre(names, layer)` — walks the candidate list against
  `[data-name="<name>"]`; when a match exists, returns the node's
  *top-edge* centre (so the pin tip touches the node and the body
  floats above the label).
- `edgeCentre(lineNames, layer)` — looks up
  `[data-attr-name="<line>"]` and prefers the **visual mid-arc of
  the rendered Bézier path** via `path.getTotalLength()` +
  `path.getPointAtLength(len/2)`, projected back into the layer's
  coord system. Falls back to the bbox-midpoint of the
  `data-source` / `data-target` node pair when the SVG length APIs
  are unavailable. Tried BEFORE `nodeCentre` when the pin payload
  carries `lineNames`. (The geometric midpoint between endpoint
  nodes was off-curve for any edge graphviz draws as a curve —
  parallel transformers, lines bowing around obstacles — and put
  pins like ``reco_CHALOL31LOUHA`` on a different line entirely.)
- `fanOutColocated(positions, baseR)` — final pass that spreads
  pins resolving to the same anchor on a small circle around it
  (radius `1.6 * baseR`). Same hash key + angular fan as
  `frontend/src/utils/svg/actionPinData.ts:fanOutColocatedPins`,
  so duplicates stay individually clickable.

### 6.5 Pin radius

`basePinRadius(layer)` samples the first `.node` group's bbox and
multiplies by 0.55, then scales the result through the layer CTM so
the radius is in the same coordinate space as the centres. Cached
per render pass (`cachedR`) — every node in a graphviz dot output
shares the same shape size class.

### 6.6 Click semantics

The pin's `<g>` listens for both `click` and `dblclick`:

- **Single click** — debounced via 250 ms `setTimeout`. If the
  timer fires (no double click follows) the overlay posts
  `cs4g:pin-clicked` with the pin's
  `getBoundingClientRect()` (in iframe-screen pixels).
- **Double click** — clears the pending single-click timer and
  posts `cs4g:pin-double-clicked` with `{ actionId, substation }`.

The debounce is a structural requirement: without it the first click
fires `onActionSelect` (which switches the active main tab), and the
follow-up `dblclick` can no longer drill into the SLD.

### 6.7 Parent-side handlers

| Message | Parent handler | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `cs4g:pin-clicked` | `onOverflowPinPreview(actionId)` + opens `ActionCardPopover` anchored on the pin | Feed scrolls to the matching card AND a floating popover (the SAME `ActionCardPopover` the Action Overview uses) opens around the pin. NO tab switch. |
| `cs4g:pin-double-clicked` | `handleOverflowPinDoubleClick(actionId, substation)` | Closes the popover, opens the SLD overlay with `forceTab='action'` for that substation. |

The popover translates iframe-screen coordinates to parent-screen
coordinates via `iframe.getBoundingClientRect()` and uses the same
`decidePopoverPlacement` / `computePopoverStyle` helpers as the
Action Overview pin.

### 6.8 SLD overlay action sub-tab

`SldOverlay`'s tab filter previously gated the action sub-tab on
`actionDiagram` (the *main-window* NAD action variant). When opened
via overflow-pin double-click, that's null. The filter is now:

```ts
if (tabMode === 'action') return !!actionDiagram || !!vlOverlay.actionId;
```

— so the action sub-tab is offered whenever the SLD overlay is
scoped to an action, regardless of whether the main NAD is on the
action variant.

### 6.9 Pins toggle UI

The toolbar exposes a single `📌 Pins` button (matching the `🏷 VL`
toggle visual) with `aria-pressed`, brand-soft fill when active,
`disabled` until step-2 actions exist.

State + posting:
- `App.tsx` owns `overflowPinsEnabled: boolean` (default `false`),
  `overflowPinsAvailable: !!result.actions`, `overflowPins:
  OverflowPin[]` (memoised; rebuilt when actions / metaIndex /
  vlToSubstation / monitoringFactor / selectedIds / rejectedIds /
  overviewFilters change), `overflowUnsimulatedPins: OverflowPin[]`
  (memoised; gated on `overviewFilters?.showUnsimulated`), and
  `allOverflowPins = [...overflowPins, ...overflowUnsimulatedPins]`
  which is the actual payload posted to the iframe.
- `VisualizationPanel` posts `cs4g:pins` on every relevant change
  (after the `cs4g:overlay-ready` handshake).

### 6.10 Un-simulated pin layer

Mirrors the Action Overview's "Show unsimulated" behaviour: when
the operator ticks **Show unsimulated** (parent OR iframe sidebar),
every action that has a recommender score but no simulation result
yet is rendered as a dashed grey "?" pin so it can be discovered and
double-clicked into a manual simulation.

#### Payload builder

`buildOverflowUnsimulatedPinPayload` in `overflowPinPayload.ts` mirrors
the simulated-pin builder but:

- Walks `actionsScoreInfo` (the score table) instead of
  `result.actions`.
- Skips any action already present in the simulated set
  (`simulatedIds`).
- Sets `unsimulated: true` on the resulting `OverflowPin`.
- Resolves the same anchor priority (load-shed / curtail → VL,
  primary lines → edge midpoint, VL targets → VL node,
  `max_rho_line` last resort).
- Populates the `title` field with `buildUnsimulatedPinTitle(id,
  scoreInfo)` — the SAME helper consumed by the Action Overview pin
  layer (exported from `actionPinData.ts` for cross-module reuse).
  Multi-line content: `"<id> — not yet simulated (double-click to
  run)\nType: …\nScore: … — rank N of M (max …)\nMW start: …\n…"`.
- Accepts the same optional `overviewFilters` argument as the
  simulated builder. When `overviewFilters.actionType !== 'all'`
  ids that don't match the active type chip are skipped before
  anchor resolution — mirroring the Action Overview's
  `unsimulatedPins` memo (`ActionOverviewDiagram.tsx:383-397`).
  The match precedence is identical: prefer `scoreInfo[id].type`
  when supplied, fall back to id-based heuristics in
  `classifyActionType`. Without this the Overflow Analysis tab's
  ACTION PINS FILTERS chip row would appear inert because the
  unsimulated layer is usually the dominant pin set on the graph
  (regression fix 2026-05-05).

#### Wire-format addition

The `OverflowPin` interface gains two optional fields:

```ts
interface OverflowPin {
    /* …existing fields… */
    /** True for score-only pins from buildOverflowUnsimulatedPinPayload. */
    unsimulated?: boolean;
    /** Multi-line tooltip; falls back to actionId in the overlay. */
    title?: string;
}
```

#### Overlay rendering (`overflow_overlay.py`)

When `pin.unsimulated === true` the overlay:

- Calls `createPinGlyph({ ..., dimmed: true })` from the shared
  factory so the body fill follows the dimmed severity palette.
- Sets `data-unsimulated="true"` on the pin `<g>` (CSS hook + test
  selector).
- Applies a dashed stroke (`stroke-dasharray="3,3"`) AND
  `opacity: 0.5` to the bubble — visual parity with Action Overview.
- Reads `pin.title` (with fallback to `pin.actionId`) and emits a
  `<title>` child on the pin so the browser's native hover tooltip
  shows the multi-line score / rank / MW-start string.

#### Distinct double-click route

A double-click on an unsimulated pin posts
`cs4g:overflow-unsimulated-pin-double-clicked` (NOT the regular
`cs4g:pin-double-clicked`). The parent's `VisualizationPanel`
message router calls `onSimulateUnsimulatedAction(actionId)` —
the same `handleSimulateUnsimulatedAction` already used by the
Action Overview unsimulated-pin path. The popover is closed first
to mirror the simulated-pin double-click cleanup.

Single click is unchanged: `cs4g:pin-clicked` still triggers the
feed-focus + popover behaviour, which works for unsimulated pins
because `ActionCardPopover` accepts a "score-only" descriptor.

### 6.11 Combined-action pins + `dimmedByFilter` constituents

Combined-action entries — actions whose id contains ``+`` (e.g.
``disco_BEON L31P.SAO+reco_GEN.PY762``) — are rendered as a
**dashed Bézier connector** between the two unitary halves with a
combined glyph (severity-coloured ``+`` badge) at the curve
midpoint. Identical visual contract to ``CombinedPinInfo`` /
``renderCombinedPin`` on the Action Overview NAD.

#### Wire-format addition

```ts
interface OverflowPin {
    /* …existing fields… */
    /** Combined pair: place pin at the midpoint of a curve. */
    isCombined?: boolean;
    action1Id?: string;
    action2Id?: string;
    /** Unitary pin failed the filter but kept as a constituent
     *  of a passing combined pin — render dimmed. */
    dimmedByFilter?: boolean;
}
```

#### Three-pass payload pipeline (`buildOverflowPinPayload`)

Mirrors ``ActionOverviewDiagram`` (the ``pins`` / ``combinedPins``
memos at component.tsx:285-380) byte-for-byte:

1. **Build every unitary anchor UNFILTERED** so combined pins
   always have endpoints to anchor on, even when one half would
   fail the active severity / threshold / action-type chip on its
   own.
2. **Determine which combined actions pass the filter**. A
   combined pair passes the *type chip* if EITHER constituent
   matches (combined actions are inherently multi-type and hiding
   the pair because one side doesn't match would surprise the
   operator). The constituent ids of every passing combined pin
   form the ``protectedIds`` set.
3. **Re-filter the unitary list**:
     - passes filter            → emit at full strength,
     - fails but in protectedIds → emit with ``dimmedByFilter: true``,
     - fails and unprotected     → drop entirely.
4. **Emit combined-pin descriptors** for the passing combined
   actions. The overlay JS computes their midpoint client-side
   from the constituent positions.

This is the difference between "combined pin disappears as soon
as one constituent fails the threshold" (the wrong UX, fixed) and
"combined pin survives, the failing constituent is shown dimmed
as context for the combined glyph" (the Action-Overview rule).

#### Overlay rendering (combined connector)

For each ``isCombined`` pin the overlay:

- Looks up the two constituent positions (after the
  ``fanOutColocated`` pass).
- Calls ``combinedCurveMidpoint(p1, p2, 0.3)`` — quadratic-Bézier
  control point offset perpendicular to the chord by
  ``dist * 0.3`` (identical math to ``curveMidpoint`` in
  ``actionPinData.ts``).
- Draws a dashed ``<path class="cs4g-overflow-combined-curve">``
  between the constituents using the combined pin's severity
  colour at ``opacity: 0.85``.
- Renders the combined pin at the curve midpoint via the shared
  ``buildPin`` factory, then appends a ``+`` badge above the
  bubble (severity-filled circle + white "+" text).

For each ``dimmedByFilter`` unitary pin the overlay sets
``opacity: 0.35`` + ``data-dimmed-by-filter="true"`` on the pin
``<g>`` — same contract as the ``dimmedByFilter`` branch in
``frontend/src/utils/svg/actionPinRender.ts``.

The combined-pin loop (and the unitary loop) are wrapped in
``try / catch`` so a single malformed descriptor cannot abort
``render()`` — every passing pin still draws.

#### What the overlay does NOT do

- **Auto-dim every constituent** of any combined pair. Dimming is
  driven exclusively by the active filter (severity / threshold /
  action-type) — same rule the React Action Overview applies. A
  constituent the operator explicitly kept above their loading
  threshold reads at full strength.

## 7. Action-pin filter sync

### 7.1 Filter contract

The same `ActionOverviewFilters` object drives:
- the Action Feed's card visibility,
- the Action Overview NAD's pin filtering,
- the overflow graph's pin filtering.

```ts
interface ActionOverviewFilters {
    categories: { green: boolean; orange: boolean; red: boolean; grey: boolean };
    threshold: number;          // 0–3 (max-loading rate)
    showUnsimulated: boolean;
    actionType: 'all' | 'disco' | 'reco' | 'ls' | 'rc' | 'open' | 'close' | 'pst';
    /** Pin-only — restricts both the NAD overview AND the overflow
     *  iframe to combined pins + their two constituents (dimmed). */
    showCombinedOnly: boolean;
}
```

The default is `DEFAULT_ACTION_OVERVIEW_FILTERS` in
`frontend/src/utils/actionTypes.ts`.

### 7.2 Filter application (parent → pins)

`buildOverflowPinPayload` accepts an optional `overviewFilters`
parameter. When passed, each action is dropped if either:
- `actionPassesOverviewFilter(details, monitoringFactor, categories,
  threshold)` returns false, OR
- `matchesActionTypeFilter(actionType, actionId, description, null)`
  returns false.

`App.tsx` always passes `overviewFilters` to the builder, so the
overflow pin set is filtered identically to the Action Overview pin
set.

**Unsimulated pins honour the same chip.** `buildOverflowUnsimulatedPinPayload`
also receives `overviewFilters` and applies the action-type chip
before anchor resolution — mirroring the Action Overview's
`unsimulatedPins` memo. Without this, the iframe's chip row would
filter only the simulated layer while the (typically larger)
unsimulated layer stayed on screen, making the chip appear inert
(regression fix 2026-05-05). The `App.tsx` memo therefore tracks
the full `overviewFilters` object in its dependency array so an
`actionType` change triggers a rebuild + re-broadcast to the iframe.

The `showUnsimulated` field is the **gate** for the un-simulated
pin layer (§6.10): when `true`, `App.tsx` invokes
`buildOverflowUnsimulatedPinPayload` and concatenates its result with
the simulated payload before posting; when `false`, only the
simulated pins are posted. Toggling the field from EITHER side
(parent overview chip or iframe sidebar checkbox) drives the same
re-broadcast through `cs4g:filters` / `cs4g:overflow-filter-changed`,
keeping the two surfaces in lockstep.

**`showCombinedOnly` — combined-only pin filter.** A pin-scoped
checkbox in both the React filter header and the iframe sidebar
restricts the overflow graph to combined-action pins + their two
constituents (the constituents come through with `dimmedByFilter:
true` so the overlay renders them at reduced opacity, matching the
"context for the pair glyph" treatment of the Action Overview NAD).
When the flag is on, `buildOverflowPinPayload`:

1. Drops every unitary pin whose id is NOT in `protectedIds` (i.e.
   not referenced by any passing combined pair).
2. Marks the surviving constituents with `dimmedByFilter: true`
   regardless of whether their own severity / threshold filter
   would have passed — they are emitted as context only.
3. Combined pins themselves still go through the normal severity /
   threshold / action-type chip; a pair that fails its own filter
   disappears, taking its constituents with it.

`buildOverflowUnsimulatedPinPayload` short-circuits to `[]` when
`showCombinedOnly` is on — un-simulated actions can never be in a
computed pair.

The flag is **pin-scoped on purpose**: the Action Feed cards do not
consult it (the feed already exposes the explore-pairs surface for
combined-action triage). Only the two pin layers are gated.

### 7.3 Iframe sidebar filter panel

The overlay injects an **Action pins filters** section appended at
the BOTTOM of the upstream sidebar (separated from the layer
toggles by a top border). The section is **always visible** — its
header hosts the canonical pins on/off toggle (📌 + checkbox), so
the operator needs to reach it before any pin has been requested.
When the toggle is off the section dims itself
(`data-pins-enabled="false"` drives the CSS opacity + the
`disabled` attribute on each remaining input).

The panel keeps only the pin-scoped controls that don't live in the
parent React app's `<ActionFilterRings>` strip:
- The **pins on/off toggle** (📌 + checkbox in the panel header).
  Posts `cs4g:overflow-pins-toggled { enabled }`; the parent flips
  `overflowPinsEnabled` and re-broadcasts via the existing
  `cs4g:pins` envelope so the iframe UI re-syncs.
- `Show unsimulated` checkbox.
- `Combined only` checkbox — restricts the graph to combined-action
  pins plus their two constituents (dimmed for context). Wired both
  ways through the `cs4g:filters` envelope: clicking it posts
  `{ ..., showCombinedOnly: true }` to the parent, and a parent-side
  toggle (Action Overview NAD) re-syncs the iframe checkbox.
- A `📌 N` pin counter in the section header. When pins are on
  the counter shows the number of pins currently *rendered*
  (post-anchor-resolution); when pins are off it falls back to the
  displayable count (`lastPins.length`) so the operator sees at a
  glance whether enabling the overlay is worth the visual cost.

The severity (action-card colour) category chips, the bulk-select
pills, the `ALL DISCO RECO LS RC OPEN CLOSE PST` action-type chip
row and the **Max-loading threshold** input were removed from the
iframe — they live in the parent React app's `<ActionFilterRings>`
sidebar strip, which is the canonical edit surface for the whole
UI (Action Feed, Action Overview, Manual Selection, Combine
Actions, Overflow Analysis pins all consume the same
`ActionOverviewFilters` object). The iframe still receives the
threshold + category + action-type filters through the
`cs4g:filters` envelope and applies them to the pin payload, but
no longer renders widgets for them inside its own sidebar.

**Chip visual** — mirrors the React `CategoryToggle` component
(`frontend/src/components/ActionOverviewDiagram.tsx:1265`): no
blue solid fill on the *selected* chip; visual differentiation
comes from dimming the *unselected* ones (`opacity: 0.65`,
muted-grey background) and tinting the active chip's border to
its swatch colour (palette matches `pinGlyph.js:SEVERITY_FILL`
exactly so the chip family reads with the pin glyph). Replaces
the legacy `background: #1d4ed8; color: #fff` solid-fill rule —
the iframe sidebar and the React Action-Overview filter row now
read identically.

### 7.4 Bidirectional sync

| Direction | Wire format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Parent → iframe | `{ type: 'cs4g:filters', filters: ActionOverviewFilters }` | Re-emit on every change to `overviewFilters` so the iframe pin pipeline applies the latest threshold / categories / action-type. The iframe stores the value in its local `filterState` but no longer renders a control for it. |
| Parent → iframe | `{ type: 'cs4g:pins', pins, visible }` | Pushes the pin payload + the on/off state. The iframe re-renders the pins layer and re-syncs the in-header pins toggle. |
| Iframe → parent | `{ type: 'cs4g:overflow-filter-changed', filters: ActionOverviewFilters }` | Operator flipped a remaining iframe control (Show unsimulated / Combined only); parent calls `onOverviewFiltersChange(msg.filters)` so the rings + feed + Action Overview pins follow suit. |
| Iframe → parent | `{ type: 'cs4g:overflow-pins-toggled', enabled }` | Operator flipped the canonical pins on/off toggle inside the iframe filter panel; parent flips `overflowPinsEnabled` and re-broadcasts `cs4g:pins`. |

Both ends are eventually consistent — the parent is the single
source of truth; the iframe just renders the remaining chips +
on/off toggle and posts changes.

## 8. Forwarded interaction events

The overlay forwards these gestures from inside the iframe to the
parent React app, where they're recorded by `interactionLogger`
(replay-ready event log):

| Wire-format type                   | Interaction event                | Payload fields              |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `cs4g:overlay-ready`               | (handshake — not logged)         | —                           |
| `cs4g:pin-clicked`                 | `overflow_pin_clicked`           | `actionId`                  |
| `cs4g:pin-double-clicked`          | `overflow_pin_double_clicked`    | `actionId`, `substation`    |
| `cs4g:overflow-unsimulated-pin-double-clicked` | `overview_unsimulated_pin_simulated` | `action_id` |
| `cs4g:overflow-layer-toggled`      | `overflow_layer_toggled`         | `key`, `label`, `visible`   |
| `cs4g:overflow-select-all-layers`  | `overflow_select_all_layers`     | `visible`                   |
| `cs4g:overflow-node-double-clicked`| `overflow_node_double_clicked`   | `name`                      |
| `cs4g:overflow-filter-changed`     | `overview_filter_changed`        | `kind: 'overflow_iframe'`   |
| (parent toolbar)                   | `overflow_pins_toggled`          | `enabled`                   |
| (parent toolbar)                   | `overflow_layout_mode_toggled`   | `to`                        |

Parent-only emitter:
- `overflow_pin_double_clicked` is logged only when
  `result.actions[actionId]` exists — stale double-clicks are
  silently dropped.

The `specConformance.test.ts` and
`scripts/check_standalone_parity.py` `_SPEC_DETAILS` table both
enforce these field sets.

## 10. Tests

### Backend (`expert_backend/tests/`)

- `test_overflow_overlay.py` — overlay injection idempotency, pin
  click/dblclick listener presence, single-click debounce sentinel,
  shared-glyph inlining, no duplicate `const SVG_NS`, pin layer
  parented inside `g.graph`, action pins filter section appended
  at the END of the sidebar, pin counter API present, **unsimulated
  pins get dashed stroke + dim opacity**, **unsimulated dblclick
  routes through `cs4g:overflow-unsimulated-pin-double-clicked`**,
  **`pin.title` is consumed when present (fallback to actionId
  otherwise)**.
- `test_overflow_geo_transform.py` — geo-mode rewrites including
  the tapered-edge body / arrowhead split.
- `test_overflow_html_dim_logic.py` — section grouping, member-
  ship-based dim model, edge-id alignment guard, `is_overload ⊂
  is_monitored` semantics.

### Frontend (`frontend/src`)

- `utils/svg/pinGlyph.test.ts` — palette parity vs design tokens,
  star / cross paths, glyph variants.
- `utils/svg/overflowPinPayload.test.ts` — anchor resolution,
  load-shed / curtail early-return, line-name vs VL fallback,
  `nodeCandidates` carry-through, plus **`buildOverflowUnsimulatedPinPayload`
  coverage**: simulated-id skip, null `metaIndex` short-circuit,
  empty score table, dedupe by `actionId`, anchor-priority parity
  with the simulated builder, multi-line `title` populated from
  `buildUnsimulatedPinTitle`, fallback to `actionId` when no score
  info is present.
- `components/VisualizationPanel.test.tsx` — toolbar toggle gating,
  message-router behaviour, popover state.
- `hooks/useSldOverlay.test.ts` — `forceTab` override.
- `utils/specConformance.test.ts` — every wire-format event has its
  required fields documented.
- `scripts/check_standalone_parity.py` — auto-generated standalone
  inherits the same gestures.

---

## 11. Reset / lifecycle invariants

- **Apply Settings / Load Study** clears `result`, which clears
  `overflowPinsAvailable`; an effect auto-disables
  `overflowPinsEnabled` when availability goes false.
- **URL change on the iframe** (regenerate-overflow-graph or fresh
  Step-2 PDF event) resets `overlayReady` (re-armed by the
  iframe's `cs4g:overlay-ready` handshake) AND drops any open
  popover.
- **Overflow layout cache** — backend
  `_overflow_layout_cache` and `_overflow_layout_mode` are cleared
  on `reset()` and on each fresh `run_analysis_step2`.
- **Filter state survives** the iframe re-load (it's owned by the
  React parent); the parent re-broadcasts `cs4g:filters` after
  every `overlay-ready`.

## 12. Verification

After any change in this feature:

```bash
# Backend
pytest expert_backend/tests/test_overflow_overlay.py
pytest expert_backend/tests/test_overflow_geo_transform.py
pytest expert_backend/tests/test_overflow_html_dim_logic.py

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run test
npm run build:standalone

# Parity gates
python scripts/check_standalone_parity.py
python scripts/check_invariants.py
python scripts/check_session_fidelity.py
python scripts/check_gesture_sequence.py

# Sanity-check the injected JS still parses (no duplicate `const`,
# no f-string brace mishap).
python -c "from expert_backend.services.overflow_overlay import inject_overlay; print(len(inject_overlay('<html><body></body></html>')))"
```

Manual smoke (small grid):
1. Load `data/bare_env_small_grid_test`, pick contingency
   `P.SAOL31RONCI`, run analysis to completion.
2. Open Overflow Analysis tab — verify three layer sections plus a
   Select-all / Unselect-all row above them, dim-instead-of-hide
   behaviour.
3. Toggle `📌 Pins` → action pins appear:
   - line actions at edge midpoints, VL actions on substations,
   - severity colours match the Action Overview palette,
   - `📌 N` counter in the new "Action pins filters" section reflects
     the count.
4. Click a pin once → feed scrolls to the card AND a popover opens
   around the pin (no tab switch).
5. Double-click the same pin → popover closes, SLD overlay opens
   with the action sub-tab selected and showing the post-action
   variant for that substation.
6. Toggle a category chip in the iframe sidebar → Action Overview
   pins and Action Feed cards filter in lock-step.
7. Tick **Show unsimulated** (parent overview OR iframe sidebar) →
   dashed grey "?" pins appear on top of the simulated set; hovering
   one reveals the multi-line tooltip (`<id> — not yet simulated …`,
   `Type:`, `Score: … rank …`, `MW start: …`); double-clicking kicks
   off the manual simulation flow (`overview_unsimulated_pin_simulated`
   appears in the interaction log).
8. Untick **Show unsimulated** → the dashed pins disappear immediately
   on both surfaces.
9. Switch to Geo layout → swapped-flow lines keep their tapered
   body AND arrowhead.
