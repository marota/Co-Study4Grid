# Co-Study4Grid — Documentation

This folder holds design docs, feature specs, performance retrospectives,
architectural proposals, and data-pipeline references for the project.
The root `CLAUDE.md` is the canonical project overview; everything here
drills into specific subsystems.

## Layout

```
docs/
├── features/        Active feature / behavior reference docs
├── performance/     Current perf reference + history/ of shipped & rejected PR writeups
├── architecture/    Refactoring plans, code-quality audits
├── proposals/       Not-yet-implemented ideas, brainstorm decks, rejected designs
└── data/            External data pipelines (OSM → XIIDM conversion, etc.)
```

## When to look where

| I want to… | Go to |
|------------|-------|
| Understand how a shipped feature is supposed to behave | `features/` |
| Diagnose a perf regression or see what's been tuned | `performance/` (and `performance/history/` for retrospectives) |
| Find an ongoing refactoring plan or quality audit | `architecture/` |
| Evaluate or revive a rejected / proposed design | `proposals/` |
| Regenerate a grid dataset | `data/` |

## Active feature docs (`features/`)

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| [`save-results.md`](features/save-results.md) | Session save/reload contract + regression-guard matrix. |
| [`interaction-logging.md`](features/interaction-logging.md) | Replay-ready event log contract. |
| [`action-overview-diagram.md`](features/action-overview-diagram.md) | Map-pin overlay on N-1 NAD + the interactive overflow viewer; filter chips + un-simulated pin pipeline. |
| [`interactive-overflow-analysis.md`](features/interactive-overflow-analysis.md) | Iframe overflow viewer (0.7.0): layer toggles, hierarchical ↔ geo layout, pin overlay injection, postMessage envelope. |
| [`detachable-viz-tabs.md`](features/detachable-viz-tabs.md) | Pop viz tabs into standalone windows; tied/detached sync. |
| [`combined-actions.md`](features/combined-actions.md) | Dual-action simulation via superposition (fast) + full sim (exact). |
| [`state-reset-and-confirmation-dialogs.md`](features/state-reset-and-confirmation-dialogs.md) | State-reset guards when switching contingencies / reloading. |
| [`actions-topology.md`](features/actions-topology.md) | Action formats + topology algorithms (switch → set_bus, Union-Find cache). |
| [`curtailment-loadshedding-pst-actions.md`](features/curtailment-loadshedding-pst-actions.md) | Renewable curtailment, load shedding, PST tap actions. |
| [`frontend-ui-improvements.md`](features/frontend-ui-improvements.md) | Voltage filter, run-button placement, color codes, always-visible tabs. |

## Performance (`performance/`)

Top-level performance reference docs (the ones that still describe
current behavior, not historical retrospectives):

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| [`rendering-optimization-plan.md`](performance/rendering-optimization-plan.md) | Critical CSS + SVG rendering tricks (`vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`, etc.) with regression risks. |
| [`performance-profiling.md`](performance/performance-profiling.md) | Benchmark table + methodology. |
| [`nad-profile-bare-env.md`](performance/nad-profile-bare-env.md) | Baseline measurements for N-state NAD generation. |
| [`walkthrough-network-rendering-profiling.md`](performance/walkthrough-network-rendering-profiling.md) | End-to-end profiling trace (14 MB SVG, 26 s cold path). |

Historical PR writeups — one file per shipped / rejected change —
live under [`performance/history/`](performance/history/). See that
folder's index for the full list.

## Architecture (`architecture/`)

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| [`app-refactoring-plan.md`](architecture/app-refactoring-plan.md) | Historical: Phase 1 + Phase 2 hook extraction from `App.tsx` (shipped). |
| [`phase2-state-management-optimization.md`](architecture/phase2-state-management-optimization.md) | Memoize wrapper functions with `useCallback` (shipped 0.5.0). |
| [`code-quality-analysis.md`](architecture/code-quality-analysis.md) | Continuous audit; latest deltas (§14–15) cover the 0.7.0 release + the function-LoC ceiling, postMessage envelope, FastAPI return-type follow-ups. |
| [`development-cycle.md`](architecture/development-cycle.md) | Chronological retrospective covering the four development phases through 0.7.0 (minimal end-to-end → features → consolidation → PyPSA-EUR + interactive overflow). |

## Proposals (`proposals/`)

Unimplemented ideas and rejected designs kept for reference.

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| [`rendering-lod-strategies.md`](proposals/rendering-lod-strategies.md) | **Consolidated** LoD rendering history + current plan. Supersedes `nad_optimization.md`, `network_rendering_profiling_recommendations.md`, and `spatial_lod_architecture_proposal.md`. |
| [`new-features-brainstorm-mars26.md`](proposals/new-features-brainstorm-mars26.md) | Brainstorm of 12 candidate features (batch N-1, heatmap, Cmd+K, shortcuts, …). French text. |
| [`ui-design-critique.md`](proposals/ui-design-critique.md) | UI critique (2026-05-01, code + screenshot review): consistency, hierarchy, NAD halo sizing, a11y, ActionCard density. Prioritizes design tokens + ActionCard redesign + halo cap + warning-tier + diagram legend. |

## Data (`data/`)

| File | Topic |
|------|-------|
| [`pypsa-eur-osm-to-xiidm.md`](data/pypsa-eur-osm-to-xiidm.md) | PyPSA-Eur OSM → XIIDM 3-script conversion pipeline. |
| [`grid-layout-coordinate-scale.md`](data/grid-layout-coordinate-scale.md) | Why `grid_layout.json` MUST be raw Mercator metres (~1.4–1.6 M span) and not the legacy 8 000-unit rescale. Operator-vs-PyPSA comparison + the 2026-05-08 fix. |

## Editing conventions

- Prefer editing an existing doc over creating a new one.
- If you write a new perf retrospective, drop it under
  `performance/history/` using a short kebab-case filename (no
  `perf-` prefix — the folder already conveys it).
- If you write a new active feature doc, put it in `features/` and
  add a row to the table above.
- Keep proposals small and self-contained; once implemented, either
  (a) rewrite into a `features/` doc and delete the proposal, or
  (b) move to `performance/history/` if it was a perf change.
