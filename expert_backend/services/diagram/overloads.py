"""Overload-detection helpers over pypowsybl networks.

Two entry points:
  - :func:`get_element_max_currents` — ``{element_id: max(|i1|,|i2|)}``
    for every line and 2-winding transformer. Used as the N-state
    reference for pre-existing-overload filtering.
  - :func:`get_overloaded_lines` — filters the above against the
    permanent current limits, the monitoring set, and an optional
    N-state reference (to exclude pre-existing overloads unless
    worsened).

Both use narrow pypowsybl queries (only ``i1``, ``i2``) + numpy
vectorisation — on the 10 k-branch PyPSA-EUR France grid the overload
scan dropped from ~1,170 ms to ~330 ms and the max-currents scan from
~300-700 ms to a few tens of ms.

      3. An element is "overloaded" when ``max_i >= limit * monitoring_factor``.
         The ``>=`` comparison aligns the N Overloads UI panel with the
         backend simulation filter (``simulation_helpers.build_care_mask``)
         which uses ``base_rho >= mf``. Without this alignment a line
         sitting just at the threshold would surface as "no N overload"
         in the UI but be silently filtered as "pre-existing overload"
         by the simulation.
      4. When ``n_state_currents`` is provided, pre-existing overloads
         (elements already overloaded in N) are excluded UNLESS the
         current moved outside the symmetric ``±worsening_threshold``
         band around its N value. This keeps lines in the action's
         sensitive area (whether worsened or improved) while still
         filtering out lines that belong to other issues.

    Returns a sanitised list by default; with ``with_rho=True`` returns
