"""Recommendation models exposed by the Co-Study4Grid backend.

This package is the *canonical* place where recommendation models are
registered for this app. The registry is deliberately tiny:

- :func:`register` decorator                 — add a model class
- :func:`build_recommender`                  — instantiate by name
- :func:`list_models`                        — introspect for the UI
- :data:`DEFAULT_MODEL`                      — default selection (expert)

Third-party packages can register additional models by importing
:func:`register` and decorating their :class:`RecommenderModel`
subclass at import time. The library
(``expert_op4grid_recommender``) only defines the base contract; the
registry lives here so the app stays in control of which models are
offered to operators.
